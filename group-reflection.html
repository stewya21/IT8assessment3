      <br />
      <h4 class="display-8">What went Well?</h4>
      <p>
        The group worked very well together and was able to come together to
        create a common goal. There was also a strong positive vibe across the
        team which made working together very easy. As a team, we definitely
        were able to achieve a great starting point for our project as well and
        actually lay some great groundwork for future development.
      </p>

      <h4 class="display-8">What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>
        Working remotely created some issues. We had multiple timezones and
        outside schedules to contend with. We also had some time constraints to
        deal with as most of us work full time.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">At least one thing that was suprising?</h4>
      <p>
        Something that was suprising was seeing how everyone jumped in to try to
        learn or solve a problem even if they didn't necessarily have the
        skills. There was definitely an inclusive and safe environment to try
        new things and make mistakes.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        At least one thing that you have learned about groups?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Working remotely across Australia is difficult and you really have to
        plan well to maximise everyone's time.

      <h4 class="display-8">Daniel Gooden's Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        I felt like the group worked well together. I have done a bit of study
        in the tech space before, so I had a better understanding of some of the
        tools, such as Github and text editors, then my other group members.
        However, they were very quick to pick up the new concepts and
        contributed in other ways that they were more inclined to. I honestly
        wish we had more time together as I believe that we could finish this
        project and upskill in our given areas even further. Overall, it was a
        wonderful experience, and I had a fun time working with everyone.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">Jamie Virgen's Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        I felt the group worked really hard and well together. I feel like the
        group was really developed and was spread out in understanding different
        aspects of Technology. I also found that when I was lacking in certain
        areas the other group members were quick to teach me and also where to
        find out where I can expand my knowledge for our project. I wish we had
        more time to work on this project cause it was fun to work with the team
        and to learn new concepts. The only thing would be the timezones and
        having a better or another way to communicate instead of just Teams as
        it was not always reliable.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">Stewart Altoft's Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        Team It8 have been working together for approximately 10 weeks. We lost
        2 team members and finished off with 4 team members who I felt worked
        well together. Reflecting on my own progress, I have learned a lot and I
        can thank the team for helping me. What I believed worked well with the
        team was our vast skills and knowledge of different areas of IT and how
        we learned from each other. The best aspect of our team was the work
        ethics of each team member. We all worked together to complete the tasks
        and assignments.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">Phillip Abboud's Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        I am very grateful to have worked with a very dedicated group of people.
        Being the youngest member in the group, the knowledge of the other
        members of the team have greatly assisted me, and I have learnt so much
        from them. Everyone was very punctual and committed to our weekly team
        meetings, which made a huge difference overall to our final product,
        allowing us to set small and manageable goals for each other, to then
        reach the final product.
