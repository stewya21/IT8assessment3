        The interview that was setup was for an IT professional who works at
        Kinetic IT that has offices all over Australia. We interviewed Grant
        Nery who works in the Darwin Kinetic IT office. Grant gave us an insight
        to the work he does at Kinetic IT which are below.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Grant works as a process manager for Kinetic IT which is an ICT service
        provider that is currently contracted by the Northern Territory
        Government to provide ICT services. His current role within Kinetic IT
        as a process manager, his title role is Service Asset Configuration
        Management (SACM). SACM is the management of all the data for the
        hardware, software and voice assets that are utilised by the Nothern
        Territory Government in all it’s agencies, departments and contracted
        service providers including Kinetic IT. Grant’s daily operational
        activities involve the processing of procurement requests for new
        hardware that has been purchased by NTG as well as requests to update
        the data of existing assets within the current tool set/database. He
        also does the Governance of and reporting on SACM related activities to
        management and the customer (NTG) which can occur on a monthly and
        quarterly basis.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
      <p>
        Kinetic IT is a contracted service provider by the Northern Territory
        Government that provides ICT services, the primary activity being as a
        service/help desk that provides ICT support to customers over the phone
        and via email. The Kinetic IT service desk is the first point of contact
        for most ICT related enquiries, requests, and incidents. The Northern
        Territory Government also have contracts with other ICT service
        providers apart from Kinetic IT that provide other aspects of ICT
        support such as desktop and server management as well as network and
        voice/telecommunications support.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h4>
      <p>
        Grant’s current role focuses solely on the management of SACM and all
        its processes. Grant currently has no other activity or role withing
        Kinetic IT that he performs as the role of SACM manager is full time. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please
        tell us about them.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The other people that Grant primarily interacts with are other process
        managers who manage different processes to SACM. These processes are
        change management, problem management, knowledge management, continual
        service improvement and quality assurance. Grant also interacts with his
        immediate manager who is the end to end/service level manager for
        Kinetic IT and the contract manager.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Grant’s interactions with other IT professionals generally involve
        activities or other processes that involve SACM to some level. This is
        because other processes such as customer service, change management,
        problem management, quality assurance, knowledge management and
        continual service improvement tie in with SACM and vice versa.
        Interactions involve discussions or meetings either in person in a
        meeting room or via virtual means through an app such as MS Teams.
        Interactions also happen via email, phone calls or via record/tickets
        within the tool sets being utilised by the Northern Territory Government
        and its ICT contractors.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        What about your interactions with clients and investors?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Interactions directly with the client (Northern Territory Government)
        and their users is very similar to the interaction with other IT
        professionals in that it almost always involves the SACM process to some
        level. These interactions though are mostly done via email or phone
        call. Physical or virtual meetings rarely ever occur unless a major
        change or incident occurs that affects the SACM process in some way.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us
        about these.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Quality assurance and the checking of data are the aspects that Grant
        spends the most time on. Grant must ensure that the asset data being
        entered/updated in the tool set/database is as accurate and correct as
        possible. This is because it is one of Grant’s primary responsibilities
        of his role as a SACM manager. The other aspects that tend to take up a
        lot of time are investigations into data discrepancies/issues and
        incidents that are reported by my colleagues, members of other service
        providers as well as from the customer (Northern Territory Government).
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Activities outside of operational tasks such as data investigations due
        to incidents, reporting on and governance of other service providers who
        perform SACM related tasks prove the most challenging in Grant’s current
        role. This is because these can take an enormous amount of time and
        focus to complete/resolve. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures
        the essence of the IT industry?
      </h4>
      <p>
        As SACM manager Grant generates reports on a monthly basis and provides
        them to the customer (Northern Territory Government). These reports
        contain information that helps them manage and maintain their fleet of
        hardware, software and voice assets. The information included in these
        reports identifies what type of hardware, software and voice services
        their agencies are using. Grant believe this to be a suitable example as
        it is the application of managing and sending information about
        hardware, software and telecommunications which are all components of
        IT.
