      <h4 class="display-8">What went Well?</h4>
      <p>
        The group worked very well together and was able to come together to
        create a common goal. There was also a strong positive vibe across the
        team which made working together very easy. As a team, we definitely
        were able to achieve a great starting point for our project as well and
        actually lay some great groundwork for future development.
      </p>

      <h4 class="display-8">What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>
        Working remotely created some issues. We had multiple timezones and
        outside schedules to contend with. We also had some time constraints to
        deal with as most of us work full time.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">At least one thing that was suprising?</h4>
      <p>
        Something that was suprising was seeing how everyone jumped in to try to
        learn or solve a problem even if they didn't necessarily have the
        skills. There was definitely an inclusive and safe environment to try
        new things and make mistakes.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        At least one thing that you have learned about groups?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Working remotely across Australia is difficult and you really have to
        plan well to maximise everyone's time.
