                  I completed my final year of high school in 2021. I started my
                  first year out of high school studying for a Bachelor of Civil
                  Engineering at UTS in Sydney. I was not particularly enjoying
                  this course, and at the time I was working as an IT Support
                  Technician for a school (in fact continuing this role today).
                  This role helped me develop a significant interest in IT among
                  other things, so I began to do some research into courses that
                  would allow me to work while studying remotely. RMIT was on
                  top of that list due its flexibility and online format. Both
                  my parents are Lebanese, but I was born in Sydney. English is
                  that the main language at home, though sometime Arabic is
                  spoken when my grandparents visit. A hobby that I have held
                  onto throughout my entire schooling life is playing and
                  recording music on my guitar and drums. I am also a huge
                  cricket fan, keeping an eye on the score for all of
                  Australia’s test matches.

                  I was born in Townsville QLD and married with no children
                  living in the Gold Coast QLD.I am currently working in
                  construction as a Plasterer and have been in the industry for
                  19 years. I graduated year 12 in 2002 and I have a trade in
                  plastering and carpentry. I enjoy the beach and water sports.
                  My wife and I own a 6.1m Quintrex Ocean sport boat. We plan to
                  travel around Australia mid-2023. My interest in IT started
                  when I completed computer studies in year 11 and 12 and
                  graduated with a certificate three in information technology.
                  Although I have not worked in the IT industry, it has played a
                  significant role within my working life. I have found myself
                  soul searching this last year, this has brought on the desire
                  to change my career. My goal is to work within Cyber
                  security/defense.

                  I was born in Malaysia but migrated to Perth, Australia at an
                  early age where I started my education. After finishing
                  secondary school, I tried a few courses at university
                  including architecture and engineering but found that they did
                  not hold my interest, so I joined the workforce in various
                  roles in hospitality and currently, in retail. I primarily
                  communicate in English though, I can understand Mandarin and
                  the Hakka dialect well, although unfortunately, my
                  communication with them is very weak. I love nature, wildlife,
                  and photography which makes hiking one of my go-to activities.
                  Other interests also include reading, baking, and cooking. My
                  interest in IT stems from the fascination of how technology
                  can improve the quality of life in our daily routines to make
                  things easier and more accessible to people. This started at
                  an early age when my father brought home our first PC to
                  improve our education .Since then, my experience in IT has
                  mostly been personal in nature. I briefly worked as a
                  contractor to a large hospital to help in the rollout of new
                  hardware to update older systems.

                  I was born in Darwin, Australia where I still live. I speak
                  English and I am learning to speak Japanese. I graduated high
                  school in 2009 and I participate in small classes for drawing,
                  and creative writing with Udemy. A enjoy many hobbies and my
                  favourites are playing games, reading, writing and drawing. My
                  interest in IT started in the last two years of Primary School
                  which were full computer classes. I learned about computer
                  systems, how they work and creating website with html in
                  notepad. I really enjoy writing programs creating applications
                  and games. I find watching code being written and then how it
                  is displayed fascinating. My interest was piqued again when I
                  met my partner who studied IT and helped me build my own PC. I
                  work for Kinetic IT doing basic trouble shooting for the NT

        In our group we have quite a diverse array of ideal jobs. Our people are aspiring to be a network and systems administrator, a cyber security analyst, a cloud architect, a fullstack engineer, and a video game programmer. These jobs are all so different but ultimately come together to make a well rounded group. If each person achieved their ideal job, the makeup would cover every technology need that arises in a team. A network and systems administrator would ensure that all hardware is working to the desired specification. A cybersecurity analyst would look after the security and work towards minimising any threats that may arise to the team. A cloud architect would ensure that the system is running on modern protocols and is scaleable for the future. A fullstack engineer would develop the code that would be responsible for running the systems. Finally, a programmer would be responsible for maintaining and developing a strong code base to work on. This team is very diverse and should be able conquer any challenges that may arise.
