                  I completed my final year of high school in 2021. I started my
                  first year out of high school studying for a Bachelor of Civil
                  Engineering at UTS in Sydney. I was not particularly enjoying
                  this course, and at the time I was working as an IT Support
                  Technician for a school (in fact continuing this role today).
                  This role helped me develop a significant interest in IT among
                  other things, so I began to do some research into courses that
                  would allow me to work while studying remotely. RMIT was on
                  top of that list due its flexibility and online format. Both
                  my parents are Lebanese, but I was born in Sydney. English is
                  that the main language at home, though sometime Arabic is
                  spoken when my grandparents visit. A hobby that I have held
                  onto throughout my entire schooling life is playing and
                  recording music on my guitar and drums. I am also a huge
                  cricket fan, keeping an eye on the score for all of
                  Australiaâ€™s test matches.

                  I was born in Malaysia but migrated to Perth, Australia at an
                  early age where I started my education. I joined the workforce
                  in various roles in hospitality and currently, in retail. I
                  love nature, wildlife, and photography which makes hiking one
                  of my go-to activities. My interest in IT stems from the
                  fascination of how technology can improve the quality of life
                  in our daily routines to make things easier and more
                  accessible to people. This started at an early age when my
                  father brought home our first PC to improve our education.
                  Since then, my experience in IT has mostly been personal in
                  nature. I briefly worked as a contractor to a large hospital
                  to help in the rollout of new hardware to update older
                  systems.

        In our group we have quite a diverse array of ideal jobs. Our people are
        aspiring to be a network and systems administrator, a cyber security
        analyst, a cloud architect, a fullstack engineer, and a video game
        programmer. These jobs are all so different but ultimately come together
        to make a well rounded group. If each person achieved their ideal job,
        the makeup would cover every technology need that arises in a team. A
        network and systems administrator would ensure that all hardware is
        working to the desired specification. A cybersecurity analyst would look
        after the security and work towards minimising any threats that may
        arise to the team. A cloud architect would ensure that the system is
        running on modern protocols and is scaleable for the future. A fullstack
        engineer would develop the code that would be responsible for running
        the systems. Finally, a programmer would be responsible for maintaining
        and developing a strong code base to work on. This team is very diverse
        and should be able conquer any challenges that may arise.

            of being helpful to others. You are quiet and unassuming and may be
            hard to get to know. However, to those who know you well, you are
            warm and friendly, eager to share in lifeâ€™s many experiences. (The
            TypeFinder Personality Test, 2022).

            I found the 63% feeling result quite interesting, showing that I
            initiate decisions based on feelings rather than thought. I believe
            that this is something that I need to work on. I was expecting the
            result from test 2, being a tactile learner. I believe being a
            tactile learner in a team environment is positive. In creating a
            team I think it would be a good start to have a discussion with team
            members prior to commencing the project on how we all learn and what
            our temperaments are. This will assist us in distributing workloads
            effectively and ensuring that each member of the team is able to
            work to their potential.

          <p>
            I think that I am a very lateral thinking type of person. I have a
            very weird taste, but I often view problems from a lateral
            perspective and am not afraid to voice my opinion when I think I
            have a solution. In a team I may not always be the best team player,
            but I will always try to find a strong solution for a problem. I
            often tend to already have a solution in my head. In a team
            situation I will need to be a good listener and open myself up to
            other ideas and solutions.

            What I think the tests reults mean to me are - that I am a creative
            thinker and I need to be able to interact with what I am learning or
            doing to help with my learning style. The negative affects of this
            is that I donâ€™t like to take charge as I prefer to follow and take
            instructions. Although I am shy, I have a good work ethic and I will
            complete any tasks assigned to me as I don't want to let the team
            down.

            No team member has the same personality test results. In fact, the
            results are very different. Although there are some disadvantages
            the proâ€™s out way the cons significantly. With our IT team needing
            many different roles from creative designer through to development,
            IT8â€™s team members have the personalities to suite these roles which
             will work towards the success of our project and team synergy.
