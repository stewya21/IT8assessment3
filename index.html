                  I completed my final year of high school in 2021. I started my
                  first year out of high school studying for a Bachelor of Civil
                  Engineering at UTS in Sydney. I was not particularly enjoying
                  this course, and at the time I was working as an IT Support
                  Technician for a school (in fact continuing this role today).
                  This role helped me develop a significant interest in IT among
                  other things, so I began to do some research into courses that
                  would allow me to work while studying remotely. RMIT was on
                  top of that list due its flexibility and online format. Both
                  my parents are Lebanese, but I was born in Sydney. English is
                  that the main language at home, though sometime Arabic is
                  spoken when my grandparents visit. A hobby that I have held
                  onto throughout my entire schooling life is playing and
                  recording music on my guitar and drums. I am also a huge
                  cricket fan, keeping an eye on the score for all of
                  Australia’s test matches.

                  I was born in Malaysia but migrated to Perth, Australia at an
                  early age where I started my education. After finishing
                  secondary school, I tried a few courses at university
                  including architecture and engineering but found that they did
                  not hold my interest, so I joined the workforce in various
                  roles in hospitality and currently, in retail. I primarily
                  communicate in English though, I can understand Mandarin and
                  the Hakka dialect well, although unfortunately, my
                  communication with them is very weak. I love nature, wildlife,
                  and photography which makes hiking one of my go-to activities.
                  Other interests also include reading, baking, and cooking. My
                  interest in IT stems from the fascination of how technology
                  can improve the quality of life in our daily routines to make
                  things easier and more accessible to people. This started at
                  an early age when my father brought home our first PC to
                  improve our education .Since then, my experience in IT has
                  mostly been personal in nature. I briefly worked as a
                  contractor to a large hospital to help in the rollout of new
                  hardware to update older systems.

                  school in 2009 and I participate in small classes for drawing,
                  and creative writing with Udemy. A enjoy many hobbies and my
                  favourites are playing games, reading, writing and drawing. My
                  interest in IT started in the last two years of Primary School
                  which were full computer classes. I learned about computer
                  systems, how they work and creating website with html in
                  notepad. I really enjoy writing programs creating applications
                  and games. I find watching code being written and then how it
                  is displayed fascinating. My interest was piqued again when I
                  met my partner who studied IT and helped me build my own PC. I
                  work for Kinetic IT doing basic trouble shooting for the NT

        In our group we have quite a diverse array of ideal jobs. Our people are
        aspiring to be a network and systems administrator, a cyber security
        analyst, a cloud architect, a fullstack engineer, and a video game
        programmer. These jobs are all so different but ultimately come together
        to make a well rounded group. If each person achieved their ideal job,
        the makeup would cover every technology need that arises in a team. A
        network and systems administrator would ensure that all hardware is
        working to the desired specification. A cybersecurity analyst would look
        after the security and work towards minimising any threats that may
        arise to the team. A cloud architect would ensure that the system is
        running on modern protocols and is scaleable for the future. A fullstack
        engineer would develop the code that would be responsible for running
        the systems. Finally, a programmer would be responsible for maintaining
        and developing a strong code base to work on. This team is very diverse
        and should be able conquer any challenges that may arise.

            of being helpful to others. You are quiet and unassuming and may be
            hard to get to know. However, to those who know you well, you are
            warm and friendly, eager to share in life’s many experiences. (The

            I found the 63% feeling result quite interesting, showing that I
            initiate decisions based on feelings rather than thought. I believe
            that this is something that I need to work on. I was expecting the
            result from test 2, being a tactile learner. I believe being a
            tactile learner in a team environment is positive. In creating a
            team I think it would be a good start to have a discussion with team
            members prior to commencing the project on how we all learn and what
            our temperaments are. This will assist us in distributing workloads
            effectively and ensuring that each member of the team is able to
            work to their potential.

            the position I am picked or volunteer for in a team. It has shown
            what position I would be better suited for. I can use the results to
            understand what other personality traits would be better suited for

          <p>
            The result of this test defines me as an Advocate personality type
            (INFJ-A). Their Strengths lie in being principled and passionate.
            Advocates should do well in a team environment as they like to help
            others and see that they succeed. ISFP learners are visual learners
            and if they feel a connection to the material, they learn it quickly
            and with passion. They are more practical than theoretical learners
            and therefore, understand better by putting what they learn into
            practice. With all these results considered, this person, although
            fine left to their own devices, can also work well in a group as
            they are agreeable and open to new and different ideas.

          <p>
            I think that I am a very lateral thinking type of person. I have a
            very weird taste, but I often view problems from a lateral
            perspective and am not afraid to voice my opinion when I think I
            have a solution. In a team I may not always be the best team player,
            but I will always try to find a strong solution for a problem. I
            often tend to already have a solution in my head. In a team
            situation I will need to be a good listener and open myself up to
            other ideas and solutions.

            The results of the tests mean to me. I am a creative thinker and I
            need to be able to interact to help with my learning style. This
            will affect me as I don’t like to take charge, I prefer to follow
            and take instructions. Although I am shy, I have a good work ethic
            and I will complete any tasks assigned to me as I won’t let the team
            down.
