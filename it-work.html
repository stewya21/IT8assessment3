      </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h4>
	  <p>
	    Grant works as a process manager for Kinetic IT which is an ICT service provider that is currently
		contracted by the Northern Territory Government to provide ICT services. His current role within Kinetic
		IT as a process manager, his title role is Service Asset Configuration Management (SACM). SACM is the
		management of all the data for the hardware, software and voice assets that are utilised by the Nothern
		Territory Government in all it’s agencies, departments and contracted service providers including Kinetic IT.
		Grant’s daily operational activities involve the processing of procurement requests for new hardware
		that has been purchased by NTG as well as requests to update the data of existing assets within the
		current tool set/database. He also does the Governance of and reporting on SACM related activities to
		management and the customer (NTG) which can occur on a monthly and quarterly basis.
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h4>
	  <p>
	    Kinetic IT is a contracted service provider by the Northern Territory Government that provides ICT
		services, the primary activity being as a service/help desk that provides ICT support to customers over
		the phone and via email. The Kinetic IT service desk is the first point of contact for most ICT related
		enquiries, requests, and incidents. The Northern Territory Government also have contracts with other
		ICT service providers apart from Kinetic IT that provide other aspects of ICT support such as desktop and
		server management as well as network and voice/telecommunications support.
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">What other kinds of work do you have to do></h4>
	  <p>
	    Grant’s current role focuses solely on the management of SACM and all its processes. Grant currently
		has no other activity or role withing Kinetic IT that he performs as the role of SACM manager is full time. 
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h4>
	  <p>
	    The other people that Grant primarily interacts with are other process managers who manage different
		processes to SACM. These processes are change management, problem management, knowledge
		management, continual service improvement and quality assurance. Grant also interacts with his
		immediate manager who is the end to end/service level manager for Kinetic IT and the contract manager.
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h4>
	  <p>
	    Grant’s interactions with other IT professionals generally involve activities or other processes that
		involve SACM to some level. This is because other processes such as customer service, change
		management, problem management, quality assurance, knowledge management and continual service
		improvement tie in with SACM and vice versa. Interactions involve discussions or meetings either in
		person in a meeting room or via virtual means through an app such as MS Teams. Interactions also
		happen via email, phone calls or via record/tickets within the tool sets being utilised by the Northern
		Territory Government and its ICT contractors.
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">What about your interactions with clients and investors?</h4>
	  <p>
	    Interactions directly with the client (Northern Territory Government) and their users is very similar to
		the interaction with other IT professionals in that it almost always involves the SACM process to some
		level. These interactions though are mostly done via email or phone call. Physical or virtual meetings
		rarely ever occur unless a major change or incident occurs that affects the SACM process in some way.
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h4>
	  <p>
	    Quality assurance and the checking of data are the aspects that Grant spends the most time on. Grant
		must ensure that the asset data being entered/updated in the tool set/database is as accurate and
		correct as possible. This is because it is one of Grant’s primary responsibilities of his role as a SACM
		manager. The other aspects that tend to take up a lot of time are investigations into data
		discrepancies/issues and incidents that are reported by my colleagues, members of other service
		providers as well as from the customer (Northern Territory Government).
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h4>
	  <p>
	    Activities outside of operational tasks such as data investigations due to incidents, reporting on and
		governance of other service providers who perform SACM related tasks prove the most challenging in
		Grant’s current role. This is because these can take an enormous amount of time and focus to complete/resolve. 
	  </p>
	  <h4 class="display-8">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h4>
	  <p>
	    As SACM manager Grant generates reports on a monthly basis and provides them to the customer
		(Northern Territory Government). These reports contain information that helps them manage and
		maintain their fleet of hardware, software and voice assets. The information included in these reports
		identifies what type of hardware, software and voice services their agencies are using. Grant believe this
		to be a suitable example as it is the application of managing and sending information about hardware,
		software and telecommunications which are all components of IT.
