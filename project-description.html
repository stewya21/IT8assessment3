      <h3>Overview - Tails</h3>
      <p>
        Tailss is a Social Networking mobile app of such. The inspiration behind
        the creation of Tailss is from many issues through the years finding
        spots to take our pets as well as finding out relevant information such
        as whether dogs are allowed, whether it's off-leash, what kind of
        facilities are available, Cat owners finding places to take their cats.
        Before Tails, pet owners would resort to looking up a blog online that
        was posted many years ago or in most cases just risking it. Tails will
        contain all this information and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the user logs into the app for the first time, they will be greeted
        by a screen asking them to sign up. There they will be prompted to give
        user details, such as name, a photo, pet name, pet information, and
        preferences for types of activities. From there, they will be asked to
        share their location and enable notifications. By sharing location,
        Tails will look for the top activities that match their preferences.
        These activities would be served to the user with the option to select
        an activity or save them for later.
      </p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        Just the other week, Dan and his partner took their dogs to some
        markets, which is usually a safe bet, and ended up turning around as
        they were not allowed inside. Things like this can be avoided with
        Tails, where you can look up activities, such as the local markets, and
        see what other users have posted about. In Dan and his partners case,
        they would have been able to see that dogs are not allowed, or a
        designated spot to leash them up with food and water bowls or maybe even
        possibly a pet creche.
      </p>
      <h3>Landscape</h3>
      <p>
        Tailss is social networking for pet owners, you could say social
        networking for pets themselves. Petzbe is the closest product/platform
        to Tailss. The point of difference is Tailss will have geolocation
        capabilities which will help to connect owners to services close by.
        Which will give pet related businesses more of an incentive to work with
        Tailss. You could consider other social networks to be a competitor
        though Tailss will be all about pets.
      </p>
      <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
      <h4>Aims</h4>
      <p>
        Every project ever created has a purpose. They also have goals that work
        towards this final target. The aim of this project upon successful
        completion would be to assist pet owners in spending better time with
        their own pets, and not having the need to continuously search for tasks
        to do with their pets. However, having an aim is one thing, but for a
        project to be completed successfully, there must be a motivation behind
        it, please see above for the team's motivation surrounding this project.
      </p>
      <h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
      <p>
        Tailss is a social media app for pet owners that utilizes location-based
        posts to serve up content to users. It was initially created in
        WordPress with the BuddyBoss plugin, but once funding is completed, it
        will be rewritten in Node.js with a React.js front end. The app's goal
        is to provide pet owners with a space to connect with other pet owners
        in their local area, share their experiences, and discover new
        pet-friendly places.
      </p>
      <h5>Plan:</h5>
      <p>
        The first step in developing Tailss is to create a proof of concept on
        Wordpress that will show off features to investors to help them
        understand what they are investing in.
      </p>
      <h5>Features:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tailss will allow pet owners to create a profile for their pets and
          share pictures, videos, and stories about their pets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can browse a map to see posts from other pet owners in their
          local area.
        </li>
        <li>Users can filter posts by pet type, location, and popularity.</li>
        <li>
          Tailss will have a search function that allows users to find
          pet-friendly businesses and services in their area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can create and join groups based on pet type, breed, or
          location.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tailss will offer a feature that allows users to schedule pet
          playdates with other pet owners in their local area.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>User Experience</h5>
      <p>
        The Tailss app will have an intuitive and user-friendly interface that
        is easy to navigate. The app will be designed to appeal to pet owners of
        all ages and backgrounds. The app's user experience will be focused on
        creating a sense of community and helping pet owners connect with their
        pets in their local area.
      </p>
      <h5>Technical Requirements:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Tailss app will be built using Node.js with a React.js front end.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app will use a cloud-based server to store user data and content.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app will utilize a geolocation API to display location-based
          content to users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tailss will integrate with popular social media platforms to allow
          users to share their Tailss content on other social media sites.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Progress:</h5>
      <p>
        The development of Tailss is currently in the initial development phase.
        The project team is working on developing the proof of concept app in
        Wordpress, to show off features, user experience, and technical
        requirements. Currently the team has an AWS server that they are using
        for development. On this, they are utilising the BuddyBoss plugin since
        it has many of the features built in to show off what Tailss can do. The
        team is also working on securing funding for the project, which will be
        used to hire a team of developers and designers to create the app. Once
        funding is secured, the team will begin the development process. The
        first step will be to build the app's backend using Node.js. The team
        will then develop the app's front end using React.js. The team will also
        work on integrating the app with popular social media platforms to allow
        users to share their content on other social media sites.

      <h4>Roles</h4>
      <p>
        Our team for this project consisted of four hard working people. Our
        development team was led by Daniel Gooden. We were very lucky to have
        Dan, bringing an enormous amount of knowledge into this project, and
        providing the team many tips and tricks. Dan was assisted by Stewart
        Altoft, as the Assistant Frontend UX and UI developer, as well as
        Phillip Abboud, as the Assistant Backend Developer. We were also
        extremely fortunate to have Jamie Virgen as a member of our team, with
        an eye for creativity, Jamie held a role in the team as the Creative
        Designer, working very closely with the User Interface of our final
        product.
      </p>

      <h4>Scope and limits</h4>
      <p>
        Due to budget limits, we will be using the most cost-effective tools for
        the launch and storyboard. For the storyboard and mock-ups for the
        mobile app, we will be using Figma. Our current budget will allow us a
        Figma starter team account which will give us up to 3 files and five
        pages to work with; Tailss home, Tailss posts, Tailss search, Tailss
        profile and Tailss compose. This will be the driving force behind
        raising funds and acquiring investors. We are using AWS Lightsale for
        cloud storage, we understand this is limited and that we will need to
        upgrade to EC2 early into the launch as the traffic will become too much
        and this expansion will reflect our budget. It is important to note that
        this is a passion project. We will be using WordPress for the web page
        however work on this will be at a later stage. All the costs combined
        including the purchase of the domain, is approximately $100 with ongoing
        monthly costs just under $100 per month.
      </p>

      

      <h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        We are building the website with WordPress. It is a great and easy to
        use solution to get us going quickly by utilising different plugins to
        handle some of the more difficult coding and backend work. However, we
        are going to be using AWS for the hosting (Lightsail) as it is currently
        very affordable but also offers options for scaling up later if
        necessary. The main plugin we are using is BuddyBoss to run the social
        media aspects of the website. We are using the free version but in the
        future we can either expand by utilising the paid version or building
        our own social media site. It has many features that allow us to get off
        the ground quickly and effectively to help create the online community
        that we are after. In the future we want to plug in the Google Maps API
        as it will allow us to have geo-located data to attach to posts. This is
        a major feature for us as we want to allow users to create suggestions
        and posts and share the location with others. Our primary form of income
        will be via advertising, so ensuring that ads are displayed properly and
        are relevant to the users is a very important feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        For tools, we would need a setup that would allow the team working on it
        to test web apps. The frontend would be built in React as it is a modern
        and quick web based front end. We would also need a live web server to
        run the backend. This is required to interface with the database and
        serve it up to the users. I have experience using Node.js with an
        Express.js framework so I would probably use this as my backend. This
        would also mean the whole project is written in Javascript, which helps
        simplify the development process. The website will be hosted on Heroku
        as it is developer friendly and cost-effective while also achieving the
        hosting needs for this project. Content would be delivered
        asynchronously as this is a social media website that allows searching
        and browsing. AJAX solves this problem as it allows content to be loaded
        asynchronously. We would also need access to the Google Maps Platform
        API. This would run the map portion of the web app. The database would
        be run from MongoDB. This allows scalability for the future and works
        well with social media type workflows.
      </p>
      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>
        Javascript is a major skill required for both the frontend and the
        backend. The frontend would be written in React, so knowledge for React
        is required. Node.js and Express.js knowledge is required to write the
        code for the backend. Knowledge of complex database types is also
        required. For the type of data we are dealing with, a NoSQL database is
        the best option. Understanding MongoDB is important for working with
        database. Familiarity with Google Maps API is also very important for
        integrating location into the app. Experience with authentication and
        cookies to manage sessions.
      </p>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        If this project is successful, I will be able to help impact local pet
        communities to help owners spend quality time with their pets. The
        problem of finding something fun and new to do with your dog or cat will
        no longer be an issue. A user can have all the data they need at their
        fingertips to help find something to do with their pet. In the end, this
        will create a stronger bond with their animal and help local pet
        communities come together to show off the best places to spend time
        together.
      </p>
      <h3>Risks</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the risks for our project are lose of productivity due to team
        members being sick, family visiting or visiting family. Other risks are
        other study commitments that can interfere with project productivity,
        prior job commitments, knowledge or lack of knowledge regarding software
        and platforms that will be used to create project, budgets and lack of
        funds, hardware/technology malfunction. Finally, the risks we have
        identified as top priority is security, network/cyber security. This
        will include storage of personal information and intellectual property.
      </p>
      <h3>Group Process and Communications</h3>
      <p>
        The communications for the group are set up through Teams, this is the
        main program we use to communicate with each other. We use canvas to
        email each other as a last resort if there has not been any
        communications through Teams. We set up meetings after the first meeting
        has been set, we try to meet over Teams recording twice a week for catch
        up and to discuss any problems. Outside of the meetings we also use
        Teams to message each other on progress as well or anything else that
        needs to be done.
