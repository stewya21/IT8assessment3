      <h3>Overview - Tails</h3>
      <p>
        Tailss is a Social Networking mobile app of such. The inspiration 
        behind the creation of Tailss is from many issues through the years 
        finding spots to take our pets as well as finding out relevant 
        information such as whether dogs are allowed, whether it's off-leash, 
        what kind of facilities are available, Cat owners finding places to 
        take their cats. Before Tails, pet owners would resort to looking up 
        a blog online that was posted many years ago or in most cases just 
        risking it. Tails will contain all this information and more. 
      </p>
       <p>
         When the user logs into the app for the first time, they will be 
         greeted by a screen asking them to sign up. There they will be 
         prompted to give user details, such as name, a photo, pet name, 
         pet information, and preferences for types of activities. From there, 
         they will be asked to share their location and enable notifications. 
         By sharing location, Tails will look for the top activities that 
         match their preferences. These activities would be served to the 
         user with the option to select an activity or save them for later.  
      </p>
      
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        Just the other week, Dan and his partner took their dogs to some 
        markets, which is usually a safe bet, and ended up turning around 
        as they were not allowed inside. Things like this can be avoided with 
        Tails, where you can look up activities, such as the local markets, 
        and see what other users have posted about. In Dan and his partners 
        case, they would have been able to see that dogs are not allowed, 
        or a designated spot to leash them up with food and water bowls 
        or maybe even possibly a pet creche.

      <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
      <h4>Aims</h4>
      <h4>Roles</h4>
      <p>
        Our team for this project consisted of four hard working people. 
        Our development team was led by Daniel Gooden. We were very lucky 
        to have Dan, bringing an enormous amount of knowledge into this 
        project, and providing the team many tips and tricks. Dan was 
        assisted by Stewart Altoft, as the Assistant Frontend UX and UI 
        developer, as well as Phillip Abboud, as the Assistant Backend 
        Developer. We were also extremely fortunate to have Jamie Virgen 
        as a member of our team, with an eye for creativity, Jamie held 
        a role in the team as the Creative Designer, working very closely 
        with the User Interface of our final product.

      <h4>Scope and limits</h4>
      <h4>Scope and limits</h4>
      <p>
        Every project ever created has a purpose. They also have goals 
        that work towards this final target. The aim of this project upon 
        successful completion would be to assist pet owners in spending 
        better time with their own pets, and not having the need to 
        continuously search for tasks to do with their pets. However, 
        having an aim is one thing, but for a project to be completed 
        successfully, there must be a motivation behind it, 
        please see above for the team's motivation surrounding this project.
      <p>
      <h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
        I have had so many issues through the years finding spots to take our
        dogs as well as finding out relevant information such as whether dogs
        are allowed, whether its off-leash, what kind of facilities are
        available etc. Cat owners also struggle to find places to take their
        cats. Usually my partner and I just resort to looking up a blog online
        that was posted many years ago or just risking it. Just the other week,
        we took our dogs to some markets, which is usually a safe bet, and ended
        up turning around as they were not allowed inside. Things like this can
        be avoided by a web app where you can look up activities, such as the
        local markets, and see what other users have posted about. In our case,
        we would have been able to see that dogs are not allowed, but there is a
        designated spot to leash them up, and water bowls for them. The app
        would contain all of this information and more. When the user logs into
        the app for the first time, they will be greeted by a screen asking them
        to sign up. Their they will be prompted to give user details, such as
        name, a photo, pet name, pet information, and preferences for types of
        activities. From there, they will be asked to share their location and
        enable notifications. By sharing location, we will be able to look for
        the top activities that match their preferences. These activities would
        be served up to the user with the option to select an activity or save
        them for later. When selecting a new activity, we would prompt the user
        to enter information such as whether off-leash, water bowls available,
        photos etc. to give them points. The points directly go to their score
        which will give them levels. This offers some kind of internal reward
        such as titles of local guide to the user to help encourage them to
        continue using the app and sending relevant, up to date data for us to
        serve up to other users. It is this constant stream of data that will
        make this app unique. I want users to enjoy using the app so that they
        will continue to come back and be happy to help give recommendations to
        their local dog community. The look and feel of the app will be minimal
        and easy quickly navigate. I want users to quickly check, make a plan,
        and answer a few questions when prompted. It should be a simple tool
        that users can tap into to help find a new recommendation for their dog
        or cat. The interface would be similar to Google Maps, with highlighted
        locations that are suggestions of places to take your pet. Some of the
        different options can be, off-leash parks, restaurants and cafes that
        are cat friendly, trails that allow dogs and cats, and beaches that let
        dogs off leash. By having the user set their preferences, they would get
        suggested places that line up with their preferences bolder than other
        suggestions. There would also be a search bar that lets them search
        through the database, serving up places that match within a certain
        radius that the user can set.
      </p>
      <h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        We are building the website with WordPress. It is a great and easy 
        to use solution to get us going quickly by utilising different plugins 
        to handle some of the more difficult coding and backend work. 
        However, we are going to be using AWS for the hosting (Lightsail) as 
        it is currently very affordable but also offers options for scaling 
        up later if necessary. The main plugin we are using is BuddyBoss to 
        run the social media aspects of the website. We are using the free 
        version but in the future we can either expand by utilising the 
        paid version or building our own social media site. It has many 
        features that allow us to get off the ground quickly and effectively 
        to help create the online community that we are after. In the future 
        we want to plug in the Google Maps API as it will allow us to have 
        geo-located data to attach to posts. This is a major feature for us 
        as we want to allow users to create suggestions and posts and share 
        the location with others. Our primary form of income will be via 
        advertising, so ensuring that ads are displayed properly and are 
        relevant to the users is a very important feature. 
      
      <p>
        For tools, we would need a setup that would allow the team working on it
        to test web apps. The frontend would be built in React as it is a modern
        and quick web based front end. We would also need a live web server to
        run the backend. This is required to interface with the database and
        serve it up to the users. I have experience using Node.js with an
        Express.js framework so I would probably use this as my backend. This
        would also mean the whole project is written in Javascript, which helps
        simplify the development process. The website will be hosted on Heroku
        as it is developer friendly and cost-effective while also achieving the
        hosting needs for this project. Content would be delivered
        asynchronously as this is a social media website that allows searching
        and browsing. AJAX solves this problem as it allows content to be loaded
        asynchronously. We would also need access to the Google Maps Platform
        API. This would run the map portion of the web app. The database would
        be run from MongoDB. This allows scalability for the future and works
        well with social media type workflows.
      </p>
      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>
        Javascript is a major skill required for both the frontend and the
        backend. The frontend would be written in React, so knowledge for React
        is required. Node.js and Express.js knowledge is required to write the
        code for the backend. Knowledge of complex database types is also
        required. For the type of data we are dealing with, a NoSQL database is
        the best option. Understanding MongoDB is important for working with
        database. Familiarity with Google Maps API is also very important for
        integrating location into the app. Experience with authentication and
        cookies to manage sessions.
      </p>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        If this project is successful, I will be able to help impact local pet
        communities to help owners spend quality time with their pets. The
        problem of finding something fun and new to do with your dog or cat will
        no longer be an issue. A user can have all the data they need at their
        fingertips to help find something to do with their pet. In the end, this
        will create a stronger bond with their animal and help local pet
        communities come together to show off the best places to spend time
        together.
